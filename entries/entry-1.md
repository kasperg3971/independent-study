## Entry1:
So for independent study I wanted to do *D3.js*


#### What is D3.js
D3.js is a JavaScript library for manipulating documents based on data. The principles of it talk about selections, transitions, data-binding, and appending nodes using data. The structure of it includes, maths, arrays, geometry, and color.
#### Why D3.js
Well D3.js has to do with Javascript and I remember when we had to do javascript as a summer assignment,
and it was fun. And also its a branch like p5.js to javascript, and easier to understand.

#### My plan for this week.
I learned that with D3.js you can do dataMaps, so I'll look more into that and I'll see if I can do anything else with it just to have a back-up plan.
