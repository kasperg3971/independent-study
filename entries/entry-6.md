## Entry 6:

### Progress throughout week:

Data!! It's great to play around with data, but too much data can take time to load, yes the rainbow circle is my new friend. So I'm inputting my data while looking for shorter data sets.

 
### Plan for this week:

Keep working on my project have it doen by next week.


### Takeaways:

A lot of data is great, but takes a lot of time
Short but effiecient and specified data is better, less time and faster.
