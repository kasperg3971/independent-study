## Entry 8:


### Progress throughout week:

So this week I have progressed and made it more interective. 
I have my data set all done and have my d3 code working.
Just looking at spots to improve in and fix.
The D3 and json work perfectly together.


### Plan for this week:
My goal for next week is to have my projectdone and completed and start preparing for my presentation.                   


### Takeaways:
Even when you still working on your project start preparing for presentations.
